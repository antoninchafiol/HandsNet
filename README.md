# HandsNet
Poor Hands Detection Neural Network

## Motivation

By using the computer everyday, a good way to be proficient is to use binded key to do a specific action, if we can't use keyboard's keys, other ways of custom "keys" can be done with oral detection for example.
This project is thought as a camera alternative to the oral one mentionnedIn order to be more efficient and/or maybe using my computer only with camera this network will detect hands on the webcam, and "translate" sign language as number.  

## Current goals

- Detect hands on a image/camera with an U-Net filter with >90% accuracy.

## Future uncertain goals

- Detect and predict joints on the image
